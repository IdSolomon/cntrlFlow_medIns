# Hello there! 👋🏽

So, this may look like a part 3 of the medical insurance project, 
but this time around, this has to do with Python control flow.

If you are unfamiliar with Python control flow, it works by utilizing boolean expressions, 
which are expressions that evaluate to either True (Yes) or False (No).

Control flow ‘flows’ down through each binary decision in the path until it reaches the end.

Nevertheless, in addition to discovering how to add emojis to better express my coding journey, 
I will apply my newfound knowledge of the Python control flow!
